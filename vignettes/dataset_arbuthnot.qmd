## Historical Context
This dataset was compiled by John Arbuthnot (1667-1735), a Scottish physician, mathematician, and satirist. He used these records to study the ratio of male to female births, making it one of the earliest known applications of statistical reasoning to a scientific question.

## Source
The original data comes from the London Bills of Mortality, which recorded christenings, burials, and causes of death in London parishes from the 16th to 19th centuries.
