## Introduction

This workbook is designed to guide you through completing the exercises for PUBH614. Please fill in your name and the date above. Each section provides a task, a space for your code, and an area to explain your code and results. All code can be run directly in the browser without the need for any installations.

**Instructions:**

1. **Copy the template** and replace the placeholder text with your own work.
2. **Write and run the code** in the provided code chunks directly in the browser. The webr package will allow you to run R code without needing any software installations.
3. **Explain your code and the output** in the provided text blocks below each code chunk.
4. **Save your work** periodically to ensure no data is lost.
5. **Knit (render)** the `.qmd` file to generate an HTML, PDF, or other output format when you're done.

# Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic and R Functions

**Task:** In this exercise, you will work with basic arithmetic operations and R functions. Perform simple calculations and use functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, and `sd()`.

```{webr-r}
# Example code for Exercise 1
x <- 10
y <- 20
z <- x + y
print(z)
```

# Exercise 2: Using Basic Mathematical Operations

**Task:**  In this part, you are going to create a program basing on the sample code above that performs the four mathematical operations

```{webr-r}

```

Run the code above , copy and paste your results in the textbox below.

<div>
  <textarea id="mathematical-operations" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Paste your results here..."></textarea>
</div>


# Performing a basic summary of a vector

```{webr-r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(numbers)
sd(numbers)
```

**Explanation:** 

**Explain the result of the addition operation and the mean and standard deviation calculations here.**

<div>
  <textarea id="scatter-plot-explanation" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
</div>

# Exercise 3: Data Manipulation with dplyr

**Task:** In this exercise, you'll practice data manipulation using the dplyr package. Load a sample dataset and perform basic operations like filtering, selecting columns, and summarizing data.

```{webr-r}
# Example code for Exercise 2
library(dplyr)
data(mtcars)
# Filter data to select only cars with mpg > 20
filtered_data <- mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 20)
# Select specific columns (mpg and hp)
selected_data <- filtered_data %>%
  select(mpg, hp)
# Summarize data
summary_data <- selected_data %>%
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), mean_hp = mean(hp))

print(summary_data)
```

**Explanation:** 

**Explain the filtering, selecting, and summarizing operations here.**

<div>
  <textarea id="scatter-plot-explanation" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
</div>

# Exercise 3: Data Visualization with ggplot2

**Task:** In this exercise, you'll create basic visualizations using the ggplot2 package. You'll plot a scatter plot and customize it with labels, titles, and colors.

**Example code for Exercise 3**

```{webr-r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Scatter plot of mpg vs hp

```{webr-r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Horsepower", x = "Miles per Gallon", y = "Horsepower")
```

**Explanation:** 

**Explain how you customized the scatter plot with titles and labels here.**

<div>
  <textarea id="scatter-plot-explanation" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
</div>

# Exercise 4: Statistical Analysis

**Task:** In this exercise, you'll perform basic statistical tests in R. You'll use t.test() for hypothesis testing and interpret the results.

**Example code for Exercise 4**

**Perform a t-test to compare mpg between two groups of cars (high mpg vs low mpg)**

```{webr-r}
high_mpg <- subset(mtcars, mpg > 20)
low_mpg <- subset(mtcars, mpg <= 20)

t_test_result <- t.test(high_mpg$mpg, low_mpg$mpg)
print(t_test_result)
```

**Explanation:** 

**Explain the result of the t-test and how to interpret the p-value here.**

<div>
  <textarea id="scatter-plot-explanation" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
</div>

# Conclusion

**Key Findings:**

Write your key findings below. What new skill have you learnt?

<div>
  <textarea id="conclusion" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
</div>

**Challenges Faced:**

Reflect on any challenges you encountered while completing the exercises. Did you have difficulty with any particular part of the analysis or R code?

<div>
  <textarea id="conclusion" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write your explanation here..."></textarea>
