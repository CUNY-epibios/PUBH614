Let’s decipher two commands (OK, might look like four lines, first two physical lines code actually part command. ’s common add break new line %>% help readability). Command 1: Take nycflights data frame, filter flights headed LAX, save result new data frame called lax_flights. == means “’s equal ”. LAX quotation marks since character string. Command 2: Basically ggplot call earlier making histogram, except uses smaller data frame flights headed LAX instead flights. Logical operators: Filtering certain observations (e.g. flights particular airport) often interest data frames might want examine observations certain characteristics separately rest data. , can use filter function series logical operators. commonly used logical operators data analysis follows: == means “equal ” != means “equal ” > < means “greater ” “less ” >= <= means “greater equal ” “less equal ” can also obtain numerical summaries flights: Note summarise function created list three different numerical summaries interested . names elements user defined, like mean_dd, median_dd, n, can customize names like (just don’t use spaces names).

Create new data frame includes flights headed SFO February, save data frame sfo_feb_flights. many flights meet criteria? Describe distribution arrival delays flights using histogram appropriate summary statistics. Hint: summary statistics use depend shape distribution.
