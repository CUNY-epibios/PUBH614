# About OpenIntro Labs

These labs were developed by [OpenIntro Statistics][OpenIntro] and adapted for 
use on the web by Levi Waldron at CUNY SPH. OpenIntro Labs promote the 
understanding and application of statistics through applied data analysis. 
Labs are titled based on topic area, which correspond to particular chapters in 
all three versions of OpenIntro Statistics, a free and open-source textbook. 
The textbook as well as original versions of the labs can be found at 
[https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/).

# About R and how to use these labs

## What are R and CRAN?

**R** is a powerful programming language and environment specifically designed 
for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians 
and data scientists for data analysis and visualization. **CRAN** (Comprehensive 
R Archive Network) is a repository that hosts R packages, which are collections 
of R functions, data, and compiled code that extend the capabilities of R. 
CRAN hosts more than 20,000 active packages, or libraries, each adding extra
functionality to R [[1](https://cran.r-project.org)].

### How is R Different from SAS and SPSS?

R is an open-source language, which means it is free to use and has a large 
community contributing to its development. Unlike **SAS** and **SPSS**, which 
are commercial software with licensing fees, R offers flexibility and a vast 
array of packages for various statistical techniques. R is highly 
customizable and preferred in academic and research environments for its 
extensibility and active community support.

## RStudio: A Powerful IDE for R

**RStudio** is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for running R. 
It provides a user-friendly interface, tools for plotting, history, debugging, 
and workspace management. While RStudio is powerful, it does have a learning 
curve, especially for those new to programming or R.

## Cloud Services for Running R

There are several cloud services that offer free tiers for running R, making it 
accessible without the need for local installation:

- **posit.cloud**: A cloud-based service by Posit (formerly RStudio) that allows you to run R and RStudio in your browser.
- **Google Colab**: A free cloud service that uses Jupyter notebooks, an alternative system for running code interactively. While primarily used for Python, it can also run R with some setup.

## Using WASM and webR for Browser-Based Labs

These labs use **[WASM]** (WebAssembly) and **[webR]** to provide a user-friendly 
alternative for running R directly in your browser. This approach eliminates the 
need for local installation or a Cloud service, and allows for interactive 
coding and visualizationwithin the browser environment.

Running R in your web browser can sometimes lead to issues such as:

- **Performance Limitations**: Browser-based execution may be slower compared to 
local execution. Even if you have a powerful computer, your browser likely only
supports up to 4GB of memory for WebAssembly applications.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you are using a modern browser that supports WebAssembly.
